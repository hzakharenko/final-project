        WESTFIELD, NJ — “Hide your things! Lock your cars! Take your keys! #DoYourPart!” reads a message board on Mountain Avenue as you enter Westfield from Route 22.
    </p>
    <p>
        These signs are part of the actions the Westfield Police Department is taking to help deter car theft, a rising problem in Westfield, according to Westfield Police Chief Christopher Battiloro. Often, the cause is residents leaving their cars unlocked with the key fob inside or nearby.
    </p>
    <p>
        This year, there have been at least 47 motor vehicle burglaries, 23 thefts and 21 recovered cars in Westfield. In 2019, Westfield had 70 motor vehicle burglaries, 22 thefts and 21 recovered cars, according to data supplied by Battiloro.

        Criminals seem to be targeting neighborhoods in Ward 1 that are close to Route 22, Battiloro said in an interview. The goal is to get the stolen vehicles on the highway quickly to deter a possible high-speed police chase, which can be too risky for officers.</p>
    <p>
        “These cars are being taken very easily, being used in commission with violent crimes in other jurisdictions, and then they are being dumped, because we are recovering them on Newark streets,” Battiloro said.
    </p>
    <p>
        This year, Newark has seen a 4% increase in auto thefts, according to Newark Police Department's Comstat unit. There were 1,098 car thefts in 2019 and 1,147 car thefts reported up to Sep. 13 this year, the figures show.

        “We recovered over 400 stolen vehicles last year and are working with the Essex County Prosecutor’s Office, the New Jersey Office of the Attorney General and the New Jersey State Police to reduce the number of vehicles we recover that are stolen from our contiguous counties,” wrote Newark Public Safety Director Anthony F. Ambrose in an email.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ambrose wrote that he does not think the rise in auto thefts are related to COVID-19. Community service officers in Newark are posting advisories on social media and distributing flyers to alert the public not to leave their cars running and unattended.
    </p>
    <p>
        Car theft has been a rising issue on both the local and state level.
    </p>
    <p>
        In January, the New Jersey State Police published a Facebook post warning people that leaving their cars unlocked could be part of the problem.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the post, they called people who leave their key fobs in their cars or nearby “fobbers” and compared them to <a href="https://www.tapinto.net/towns/westfield/sections/green/articles/njda-asks-public-to-help-kill-spotted-lanternfly-an-invasive-pest" target="_blank">the Spotted Lanternfly</a>, an insect species known to be invasive in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
    </p>
    <p>
        <blockquote>
            “Now, here’s the thing, we urge to the public to NEVER leave a key FOB inside of an unlocked vehicle—or a locked vehicle for that matter,” wrote the New Jersey State Police in the post. “People who leave key FOBs inside of vehicles are making it easy for car thieves. All they have to do is simply get inside YOUR car and drive away.”
        </blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
        According to Battiloro, in the majority of incidents in Westfield, the stolen vehicle was left unlocked at the time of theft or the key fob was left in the vehicle or nearby. The police department has found that suspects appear to be <a href="https://www.tapinto.net/towns/westfield/sections/police-and-fire/articles/3-vehicles-stolen-5-entered-in-weekend-spree-westfield-police-say-updated" target="_blank">pulling on car door handles</a> until they find an unlocked car and then burglarizing or attempting to steal the car.

        “We recommend locking your car, hiding your valuables and removing your key fob … and that means not leaving it behind in the vehicle,” wrote Battiloro in an email. “Most car thefts are occurring during the overnight hours, so it should be taken inside and secured in your residence.”
    </p>
    <p>
        The Westfield Police Department has been targeting its patrols to affected neighborhoods, Battiloro said. Police are also attempting to educate the public to do their part by locking their cars and reporting suspicious activity.
    </p>
    <p>
        The department has been delivering these messages through message boards throughout Westfield and handing out flyers door-to-door in targeted areas.
    </p>
    <p>
        “The police are doing their part as far as patrolling those neighborhoods and putting investigative resources into investigating these crimes,” Battiloro said. “But at some point, the residents need to do their part as well.”
